This project is open source and open to any and all productive input. 

It is a fan project designed with the hope of creating a free and enjoyable experience for fans of the games.

All artwork, sounds, and game mechanics are sole property of GameFreak, The Pokemon Company, and Nintendo.

Now that that's out of the way, time for to do list and progress!

TODO:
- Implement the SQL file as a program asset (Lots of data, compiling still as time of writing this).
- Write DB adapter class to extract data from the sql.
- Once adapter class is written, work into the MoveFactory and PokemonSpeciesFactory classes, create arrays of both these objects for quick access in-game.
- Our goal right now is to establish a working battle system that can handle any Pokemon with any moves, held items, etc.

PROGRESS:
- Battle math is near-complete. (Requires some item implementation still)
- PokemonFactory class complete. Inserting a species into the class along with EV/IV values will provide a pokemon with correct stats.
